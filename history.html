  <p>yes :(</p>
  <p style="color: gray"> in addition: i kept this one with the name because no one knows who "7amada" is</p>

  <p>no but if you tell me I won't share the question and I wont answer questions with names because if someone really wanted to ask something in private they can do it in my dms</p>
  <p style="color: gray">update: later found out my cousin asked this one and they were gonna say they're the person who said the crush thing but then decided to call me and tell me it was them (i don't know who sent the crush message but it wasn't my cousin)</p>
</div>

<div class="qna">
  <p style="color: pink">11/9/2024 - 9:29 PM</p>
  <p style="color: lightyellow"> Why did you disappear</p>
  <p>because I wanted to start over but didn't know how to start over smoothly and then I started over in a snappy way anyway because there was no way to start over smoothly and because I didn't feel like making videos</p>

  <p style="color: lightyellow"> ليه مش بطيق اقعد معايا انا معاك في الفصل و المدرسة</p>
  <p>I would know the exact reason if I knew who I was talking to but probably and mostly because of what you do when I do sit next to you</p>

  <p>I just realised I didn't see the t last time I read this so I'll reanswer: I don't hold grudges against anyone and I always forgive everyone even if they wronged me and if I did hate someone in particular I wouldn't say who as they'd probably see this</p>
  <p style="color: gray">old reply: there's no good reply to this one but I won't be defensive I can get on some people's nerves sometimes</p>

  <p style="color: lightyellow"> Ur voice is so beautiful</p>
  <p>sometimes I wish to go back in time and change some parts in some songs and I have this problem where my voice sounds better in real life than on the mic but I believe that's just the same with everyone</p>
</div>

<div class="qna">
  <p style="color: pink">11/9/2024 - 7:02 PM</p>
  <p style="color: lightyellow"> How are you?</p>
  <p>I'm doing fine</p>
</div>

<div class="qna">
  <p style="color: pink">11/9/2024 - 6:58 PM</p>
  <p style="color: lightyellow"> I know you don't know me but I have a crush on you, ana fi NFS el mdrsa el enta fiha</p>
  <p>It's very difficult for me to believe you and I believe that you're someone that's just trying to get a quick laugh but if it's true I'll say that some people have liked me before then I found out during the time they did and I sometimes did like them back but I never get the courage to say it</p>
  <p style="color: gray"> correction: i actually only liked them back once now that i think about it but i do get to find out when people like me alot of times but i mostly don't do anything about it and it just gets really awkward and then they lose interest</p>

<div class="qna">
  <p style="color: pink">11/9/2024 - 6:53 PM</p>
  <p style="color: lightyellow"> love you my friend</p>
  <p>I probably love you too whoever you are</p>

  <p style="color: pink">11/9/2024 - 6:50 PM</p>
  <p style="color: lightyellow"> Did you produce the two songs you recently released?</p>
  <p>not fully I find songs and try to mimic the instrumental best I can then release it though I would like do it someday and I have tried but it's pretty difficult because 1. I have no equipment 2. I wouldn't know how to use it</p>
