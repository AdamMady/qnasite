    <h1>random thoughts i wanted to write down</h1>     <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/11/2024 - 11:30 PM</p> <p>do <span class="ot">you</span> ever think about  going back in time?</p>  </div>       <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/11/2024 - 9:00 PM</p> <p>i should take a break from that song and find a good short thing to make. "it go one two three four five, six SEVEN! eight nine. im 'alive and i'm 'alright 'it's just fine and 'im going to make things rig'hht" that could be a good one to make right now actually</p>  </div>       <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/11/2024 - 8:19 PM</p> <p>ok i feel better</p>  </div>       <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/11/2024 - 7:41 PM</p> <p>my head is going everywhere at the same time and this has only happened a few times in my life and i don't know how to write everything at the same time it would be too stupid to do that anyway? or would it? get rid of the useless thoughts then get to the useful ones after: ten billion bugs and seven thousand trees and eight trillion grapes and worlds made of green beans and mice made of electronics and keyboards made of mice and keys made of carpet. why does that make complete full sense at this time? i know i won't get it later on, and i wanna explain it but i don't want the understanding to get so far ahead of time that it gets to a point where time doesn't exist and i want time to decide to take a few steps back? in? time? so it goes through itself but wait no no no no it actually has a no wait what does it have no that doesn't make any sense what am i saying? how can time go back in time!? time can only go back correct? but it technically can't time is 100% 3d i get this i understand this. no i don't i'm lying to myself? ok now that these thoughts are a little weaker: i remember the moment of the time i sent THE MESSAGE why did you send this!?!? you fucking idiot don't do anything like this again leave <span class="ot">you</span> the fuck alone you can't get a hint and you also won't leave <span class="ot">you</span> alone because you are a complete idiot that has let go of everything but can't let go of this one thing and you also know you won't let go after you type all this out there is no way for this to leave your mind at this very time. can <span class="ot">you</span> reply or block me please please pelase please pelase please i won't annoy <span class="ot">you</span> after i'm blocked and that is a promise i want a reply more than anything but i also don't mind closure. now after all of that it's time scream in lowercase aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa and in uppercase but not for too long AAAAA ok. <span class="ot">you</span>'re made to do the things you do and i know <span class="ot">you</span> are ready to do it, i know that it's crazy but <span class="ot">you</span> just have to think it through. hundered percent sure nobody would spend this much effort for one person because nobody is that stupid and stupidly stupid. stupidness, idioticrocycrocsylololosflaowasfpwoqsfkwajsdhwasg. aoaoaoaoaoaaaoaoaoaoaaaoaaoaooaaoaooaoao? hell yeah fuck no. wow i must be totally insane. new discovery: i'm a grape</p>  </div>       <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/11/2024 - 6:50 PM</p> <p>maybe i should make a summary of thoughts each day using ai but i feel like i'll forget to do it manually so it would need to be automated but i'm too lazy to do that</p>  </div>       <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/11/2024 - 5:26 PM</p> <p>fucking hate that song i made that only <span class="ot">you</span> saw</p>  </div>       <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/11/2024 - 5:24 PM</p> <p>well i mean technically the brain is split into two but is connected and each one can live independently (with it's organs) but then i'll think again and say that we are very extremely different from plants but we could still be the same. i could ask google but that just answers the question i like to stay curious</p>  </div>       <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/11/2024 - 5:22 PM</p> <p>does every leaf have it's own life or does a plant exist as one life and leafs are just like the parts that make it up kinda like our organs?
