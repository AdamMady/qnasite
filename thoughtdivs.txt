    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 11:11 PM</p> <p>so you should notice a little delay before the thoughts appear (but now all thoughts will update instantly when i send them)</p>  </div>
    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 11:10 PM</p> <p>ok i made said changes</p>  </div>

    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 6:37 PM</p> <p>here's a weird thing: i follow almost everyone who follows me but they mostly go completely back on their follow when i do that, why does this happen? is there some following guideline that i don't know that is just set in place? don't understand people mostly so don't know why im wondering about this specific thing right now</p>  </div> 
    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 6:30 PM</p> <p>time is running out</p>  </div>

    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 6:10 PM</p> <p>fuck man i can't focus on any lesson because of this song stuck in my head the song being <span class="ot">you</span></p>  </div> 
    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/15/2024 - 5:59 PM</p> <p>what if I make this more of a voice message thing?</p>  </div>

    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/14/2024 - 10:51 PM</p> <p>you know sometimes i type out things then hesitate to send them and delete them but sometimes my program glitches and sends it anyway and i think it's kinda cool and i also think it should automatically send everything so i don't ever do that hesitate thing but i also don't really wanna do that because i'd type out something way too personal and or something i don't want people to know yeah ok i'm gonna stop typing things</p>  </div>
    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/14/2024 - 10:47 PM</p> <p>and we've got to know what's goin on why does removin the g in the end of words make them sound completely different like walkin talkin sayin idk it's very very useless</p>  </div>

    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/14/2024 - 6:52 PM</p> <p>this is kinda weird because anyone who goes through my thoughts would go through the more recent one first then the one after it can make you think it's the thought after it but it's not. maybe I should make it say how long ago the thought was</p>  </div>
    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/14/2024 - 4:47 PM</p> <p>I love <span class="ot">you</span></p>  </div>

    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/13/2024 - 1:58 AM</p> <p>me being sick makes have to try so much harder for the vocals damn does it take like 7 takes for each single line but it's okay it also makes me not let go of vocal mistakes so easy because they're so noticable</p>  </div>
    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/13/2024 - 1:53 AM</p> <p>i was thinking the thought below in frustration but i think at some point it might genuinely be true but necessary and i hope it doesn't come to that point</p>  </div>
    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/13/2024 - 12:15 AM</p> <p>genuinely if nothing happens after this song i think i might just block <span class="ot">you</span> myself because i would truly be wasting my time at that point, no seriously i truly think i'll </p>  </div>
    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/13/2024 - 12:06 AM</p> <p>i'm gonna try to take my sweet sweet time making this next one. i really want there to be ZERO imperfections in the vocals/sound. it would terribly be so terrible for me to make another terrible rushed thing. i want every part to sound just right and perfect</p>  </div>
    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 11:46 PM</p> <p>can <span class="ot">you</span> hesitate one more time i don't think i'd wait for you to just reply this time</p>  </div>

    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 11:18 PM</p> <p>i believe that having something like this is 10 times better than a journal and can be added to any for easier access device, but with a journal you'd need to first find it, find a pen, grab the pen, grab the journal, open the journal and then by the time you did all that the thought is out of your head and you don't know what to write so you'll end up retracing your steps and to try to remember and you might remember but man would that be such a hassle to have to go through that every time</p>  </div>

    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 6:19 PM</p> <p>why do i keep coming back to this when there's nothing interesting on my mind but then as i type out nothing interesting something interesting comes to mind and im suddenly wondering if anyone stalks this page from time to time but then i realize that it doesn't really matter if anyone does infact do that. do <span class="ot">you</span> stalk this page? if so then have a good day</p>  </div>

    <div class="thought-box">      <p style="color: pink">11/12/2024 - 5:02 PM</p> <p>i wonder if i do keep this thoughts page up for a really long time would it keep me alive after i die? hope im thinking very far ahead of time because you never know</p>  </div>
